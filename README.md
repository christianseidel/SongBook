## MY SONG BOOK: A Private Collection of Song Sheets
The idea of [My Song Book](https://mysongbook.herokuapp.com/) is to offer a tool to efficiently manage song sheets
and other related resources of songs you want to play, rehearse or start 
to learn.

### Combining Off- And Online Content
This app allows you to combine your offline song sheets with 
resources you discover online such as tutorials and lead sheets. 
Furthermore, it will provide for fields of data where you beef-up your
collection of songs with your own comments and pieces of information.

### Import Your Song Sheet Collections
A centerpiece of this app is an import feature which allows you to import 
the content lists of various hardcopy songbooks. You will then be able to 
browse through the entire list of your song sheets from one single point
of reference.

### Keep Focus, Gather Inspiration
With all of its functionalities combined this Song Book will empower you to 
do two things: Keep focus while you learn and practice on a daily basis by 
sticking to a Focus List (yet to be implemented), while at the same time 
collect new ideas and inspiration which you may want to turn to at a later 
point in time.
