## MY SONG BOOK: A Private Collection of Song Sheets

The idea of this app is to offer a tool to efficiently manage song sheets
and other related resources of songs you want to play, rehearse or start 
to learn.

### Combining Off- And Online Content
It will eventually allow to combine both your offline song sheets and 
resources you discover online such as tutorials and lead sheets. 
Furthermore, it will provide for fields of data where you beef-up your
collection of songs with your own comments and pieces of information.

### Import Your Song Sheet Collections
A centerpiece of this app is an import feature which allows you to import 
the content lists of your different hardcopy songbooks. You will then be
able to browse through the entire list of your song sheets from one single 
point of reference.

### Keep Focus, Gather Inspiration
Once all functionalities integrated, your Song Book will empower you to do 
two things: Keep focus while you learn and practice on a daily basis by 
sticking to your Focus List, while at the same time collect new ideas and 
inspiration which you may want to turn to at a later point in time.
